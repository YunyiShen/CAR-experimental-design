### The Effect of the Prior and the Experimental Design on the Inference of the Precision Matrix in Gaussian Chain Graph Models

This is the code base for Shen Y, Solis-Lemus C. The Effect of the Prior and the Experimental Design on the Inference of the Precision Matrix in Gaussian Chain Graph Models[J]. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2107.01306, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01306). (accepted at [JABES](https://link.springer.com/journal/13253)).

Simulation with increasing sample size and different prior, experimental design and mispecifications are in [`numerics`](https://github.com/YunyiShen/GCG-experimental-design/tree/master/numerics), while the toy example and real data example are in [`toy_model`](https://github.com/YunyiShen/GCG-experimental-design/tree/master/toy_model). Realdata used can be found at [`data`](https://github.com/YunyiShen/GCG-experimental-design/tree/master/data).
